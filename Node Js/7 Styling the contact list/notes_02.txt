1. To delete a contact
2. Firstly we will add a delete button while looping the contact list
3.
<% for(let i of contact_list){%>
 <li>
    <span id="c-name"><%= i.name %></span>
    <span id="c-name"><%= i.phone %></span>

    <!--To delete a contact-->
    <div class="delete-button">
        <a>
                                    
        </a>
    </div>
    </li>
<%} %>

4. We did <a> because it will take us to controller wherein it will find a contact and delete it

5. Make a controller for delete
6. For deleting from array we will use splice


7. Param : String And Query
8. If we are using string param or param
i.e /delete-contact/10 
we need to tell controller the type of data
app.get("/delete-contact/:phone", function(req,res){
    let phone_to_be_deleted = req.params.phone;
});

9.In my HTML file i do this
<div class="delete-button">
    <a href="/delete-contact/<%= i.phone%>">
        //Accessing the phone and passing it to controller
        <i class="fas fa-window-close"></i>
    </a>
</div>


10. Query Param 
app.get("/delete-contact", function(req,res){
    console.log(req.query);
    let phone_to_be_deleted = req.query.phone;
});

And in HTML file also : 
<div class="delete-button">
    <!--For query-->
    <a href="/delete-contact/?phone = <%= i.phone %>"></a>
        <i class="fas fa-window-close"></i>
    </a>
</div>

This is same as form sending data to server
so to process it here also we need a middleware

11. When using query...you can see the same thing in the URL tab of browser
Like this
http://localhost:8000/delete-contact/?phone=70091551331

12. I will append the name also ... because i can chain using Query Param

13. To append in HTML
<a href="/delete-contact/?phone=<%= i.phone %>&name=<%= i.name%>">

14.Now if you kill the server and check the URL you would see that
if the name has space it would appear as %20%.... because
the string having spaces has undergone URL friendly conversion
URL can't contain spcaes so it does this

Like this
http://localhost:8000/delete-contact/?phone=8521364790&name=Hello%20World


To kill the server , after you press the delete button
press ctrl+c in your terminal

15. But we will limit to phone only

16. We will iterate over the contact list...find the index 
of the phone number and then we will delete it...if found

app.get("/delete-contact", function(req,res){   
    let phone_to_be_deleted = req.query.phone;

    let contactIndex = contactList.findIndex(contact => contact.phone == phone_to_be_deleted);
    //Inbulit fxn : find index
    //contact will point to each object in list one by one
    //== bcoz we arent going for strict checking
    if(contactIndex != -1){
        contactList.splice(contactIndex,1);
        //Basically moving "1" to left
    }
    return res.redirect("back");
});
