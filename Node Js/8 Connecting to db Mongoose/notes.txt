1. Till now what was happening that our data was in RAM
Changes reflected in RAM and as soon as we restart our server
Changes are gone....we don't want that.

2. Soltution : Databases
3. We will use NoSQL Database : MongoDB
4. Storage in form of JSON objects

5. Our server will interact with Database server.
6. MongoDB is very widely used with NodeJs.
7. It is open source.

8. Why MongoDB ?
- Ease of use ... you don't need to define any structure
- Two important things : MEAN and MEARN
- MEAN : MongoDB , Express , Angular , NodeJs
- MERN : MongoDB , Express , React , NodeJs
- Angular and React are Frontend frameworks on JS
- These two are more popular development stack


9. Terminologies related to MongoDB
- Fields : The keys in the JSON file.
- Document : A particular object in the list.
- Collection : The list is known as Collection.
- Database : Set of Collection.

10. You don't need to learn the core language of that particular tech.
For ex : to access data in MongoDB you need to learn its language.
But the thing is people have created a layer over Express which is 
known as ODM and you need to interact with that ODM.
ODM = Object Document Mapper
Wrapper written over MongoDB

11. Similarly comparing it with Tabular Databases , they have ORM
Object Relational Mapper.

12. Under NoSQL : MongoDB is Document Database

13. Steps we will follow
- Install MongoDB and Check.
- Install Robo 3T : GUI which helps to visualize data
- Installing Mongoose from NPM
- Setting up configuration
- Running server amd testing
