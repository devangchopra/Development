Whenever we update our code....we need to restart our
server...to solve this issue we use a package named
as nodemon.

It monitors our project
As soon as updations come
it restarts automatically

To install it
TERMINAL
npm install -g nodemon

-g stands for gloabal
Globally in that package / directory we are installing it


Once you install the nodemon
To run the server you need not to write node index.js
Now write nodemon NAME OF FILE

Now the moment you save the unchanged code...nodemon
will start automatically



Whenever i am running the server...it reads through
the whole file , compiles and loads all the functions
to the memory and calls them when required.
When it loads all fxns...it doesnot loads the data of 
HTML file...it will get rendered at time of opening in the browser
